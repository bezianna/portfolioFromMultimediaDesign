                        "It is amazing how often people solve the problem before them without
                        bothering to question it. Engineers and businesspeople are trained to solve problems.
                        Designers are trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong
                        problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem." <br><br> /Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

                        This is the principle of User Experience design. To start every project by determining the problem and continue with research,
                        design thinking in teams, then developing a wonderful product based on constant iterations including the refinement after testing, so the best possible
                        UX can be achieved.<br>

                        Slovakfolklore's online presence was confined to social media. Based on user research,
                        it was discovered, that a website would help the company's credibility with providing
                        necessary information in one platform.<br><br>
                        The website was developed in collaboration with the company and with two other students.
                        The focus was on prototyping and reaching the best possible UX.
